# Hildegard von Bingen Clinical Trial

Tools for better display of an ongoing N=1 natural medicine clinical trial's results:
- treatments (coming soon),
- blood markers.

The trial has started in August 2023.

Data comes from a private Google Spreadsheet.
Rows have been feed by hand and/or through a Google Forms (the patient enters there daily treatments taken).

The clinical trial follows a weekly serology measurement, crossed with windows of at least 2 weeks of unchanged protocol. This is gives a hint of which protocol works best if ever it works.
Lack of sleep and high stress are unfortunately not noted down for the periods, even though they have been occuring often during the trial. Those situations create validation decision noise, preventing to establish whether the treatments would work at all, on patients with same pathological status.

Science tags: cancer, testicle, testicular, natural medicine, chemotherapy.
