> This draft article accompanies an ongoing series of N=1 clinical trials with the same patient on the topic of stage 1 testicular cancer curing or slow down attempt food supplements, especially natural extracts, and more precisely the drug retargetting of extracts initially intented for counteract or repair masculine hypofertility.

## Context
Testicular cancer scarcity & growing trend....
Curing protocol recommended by various scientific societies start with orchiectomy in order to remove the cancerous cells and stem cells, unfortunately along with healthy cells, which provides strong patient discomfort.
Orchiectomy is practiced because of several drawbacks of chemotherapies (usually a platinum-based intravenous drug): hardly penetrate the testicle cells to trigger in-situ apoptosis, they damage the testicle and decrease its fertility, they do not tackle cancerous stem cells. Radiotherapy is also an option without the low penetration disadvantage. Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy may lead to shorter terms in-situ cancer retakes, while orchiectomy of the entire gonad does not. In order to preserve masculine traits at best, when magnetical resonance imagery and/or ultrasound show that only an isolatable zone has germ cells tumor, partial orchiectomy[^2] can be undertaken followed by physiopathological analysis, long term imagery monitoring and testicular cancer blood markers measurement (AFP, HCG, betaHCG, LDH and/or the more specific M371). After partial orchiectomy, if both blood markers remain elevated and/or the exeresed cells correspond to an aggressive cancer type, full orchiectomy is advised.
Testicular cancer may induce or coexist with hypogonadism embodied by hypofertility easily characterized by spermogram values, namely the total number of motile spermatozoa factor (TMSC[^1]) and/or low testosteronemy.

When contemplating both single or double orchiectomy, male patients are advised to prepare for a hypothetical future in vitro fertilization process (within a couple relationship or after sperm donation if the residence country allows it) through semen cryopreservation, most often through masturbation, before orchiectomy. In the case of an orchiectomy of both testicles, patients shall also decide on a lifelong remediation to low or null testosteronemy, for after that surgery. In France, pathologically-relative testosterone supplementation is reimbursed by the national health insurance (Sécurité sociale), in its 3-weeks lasting seringes form.

### Psychological and bioethical considerations on orchiectomies 
- psychological discomfort
- psychological violence
- principle of double-effect vs. primum non-nocere

### Phythotherapeutical chemotherapy and cancer immunosurveillance tracks
- in progress[^3]

## N=1 and first in human (FIH) approach
- in progress

## Clinical trial periods
- summer 2024 3 weeks
- fall 2024 1.5 months
